Hello there! <br>
On this page, I'd like to share more about myself. My name is Ivelin Yanev, and I was born in Burgas, Bulgaria. 
Looking back, my passion for technology was ignited by my father, who, like a typical Bulgarian, was skilled at home repairs.
As life unfolded, I found myself in a technical school with a specialization in radio and television. 
It was there that I became a radio amateur and started collecting and restoring vintage Bulgarian equipment, primarily from the socialist era. 
This included a wide range of radio and television receivers, both assembled from discrete components and integrated units. 
Thankfully, during the socialist era, Bulgaria was a prominent producer of such equipment, with brands like Elpron, Pliska, Veliki Tarnovo 84, Resprom, Sofia 81, and Shipka leading the way.

To be candid, my software knowledge was quite limited during that period. However, I stumbled upon a renowned Bulgarian book from the golden age of Bulgarian
computer industry. This book, titled "Тhe microprocessor - the heart of the microcomputer" provided detailed instructions on how to design a microcomputer from scratch.

Inspired by this resource, I delved into working with microcontrollers from the PIK16 series, which were manufactured by the American company Microchip.

In the image below, you can see my own creation - the PIC programmer. This programmer is powered by a PIC 18F2550 microcontroller and interfaces through the serial port. It seamlessly integrates with MPLAB IDE software, Microchip's robust code development environment, facilitating program execution, stopping, and single-stepping.

Thanks to this PIC programmer, I've successfully programmed an extensive array of Microchip PIC series, including the 10F, 12F, 16F, 18F, 24F, and 30F microcontrollers. It's noteworthy that this programmer also doubles as an EEPROM programmer, as it offers support for 12Cxx EEPROMs.

 As a result, by the end of my school years, I had already built my first logic machine. This device was created using TTL integrated circuits and a 27C256 256K bit EPROM chip. Its core function was to measure voltage, frequency, temperature, and RPM, and display the results on a seven-segment display. Users could select different subroutines using buttons on the front panel.

After winning math competitions, I had the opportunity to choose which university to attend. 
I initially entered with the intention of working on automated systems, but my enthusiasm waned when 
I realized that finding a job in this field in Bulgaria was challenging. 
Consequently, during my second year at university, I shifted my focus towards more popular technologies in the web sphere.

Over the course of my career, I've had the privilege of working across a diverse range of companies, each offering unique challenges and opportunities. This journey has provided me with a broad spectrum of experience, spanning from robotic systems to web-based software solutions.

My professional journey has encompassed a wide array of projects, including ventures into the realm of Medical Software development and embedded systems. Notably, I've been involved in developing autonomous systems with Odometry.

In the realm of IoT (Internet of Things) and Industrial IoT (IIoT), I've architected and developed custom solutions, leveraging my proficiency in technologies like Qt, Qml, Java, and M2M communication protocols. One of my significant accomplishments involved creating a C8Y agent for DMG MORI's CNC machines. This agent facilitated the safe and efficient installation of software packages and updates, even in critical conditions. Additionally, I implemented a scheduler to process tasks within defined time windows, enhancing the agent's reliability and performance.

Furthermore, I've contributed to and maintained a custom solution for T-Systems' IIoT facilities management, a project that demanded expertise in cloud computing, data analytics, and IoT sensor integration. Another notable achievement involved crafting a tailored migration solution for Schindler, accommodating the unique requirements of various device types. This solution streamlined their migration process and minimized downtime.

In my most recent project, I developed a new C8Y connectivity provider based on KITE integration for Telefonica. This integration seamlessly integrated with their existing infrastructure, significantly improving device management and monitoring capabilities.

Throughout my career, I've delved into diverse domains, from Industrial IoT solutions to web-based systems and integrated parking solutions. As an experienced software engineer, I've honed my expertise in IoT, IIoT, Microservices, and IoT Edge Gateway technologies. In recent years, my primary focus has centered on building mission-critical, high-performance microservices-oriented systems using cutting-edge technologies such as Java Native Image and Go.

While I've explored various programming languages, including Java, C, Qt, JavaScript, PHP, and Erlang, my current emphasis is on JVM (Java Virtual Machine) technologies. I firmly believe that programming languages are merely tools to help us achieve our goals, and my commitment remains unwavering in delivering excellence in software development.
