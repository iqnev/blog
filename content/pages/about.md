Hello there! <br>
On this page, I'd like to share more about myself. My name is Ivelin Yanev, and I was born in Burgas, Bulgaria. 
Looking back, my passion for technology was ignited by my father, who, like a typical Bulgarian, was skilled at home repairs.
As life unfolded, I found myself in a technical school with a specialization in radio and television. 
It was there that I became a radio amateur and started collecting and restoring vintage Bulgarian equipment, primarily from the socialist era. 
This included a wide range of radio and television receivers, both assembled from discrete components and integrated units. 
Thankfully, during the socialist era, Bulgaria was a prominent producer of such equipment, with brands like Elpron, Pliska, Veliki Tarnovo 84, Resprom, Sofia 81, and Shipka leading the way.

To be candid, my software knowledge was quite limited during that period. However, I stumbled upon a renowned Bulgarian book from the golden age of Bulgarian
computer industry. This book, titled "Тhe microprocessor - the heart of the microcomputer" provided detailed instructions on how to design a microcomputer from scratch.

Inspired by this resource, I delved into working with microcontrollers from the PIK16 series, which were manufactured by the American company Microchip.

In the image below, you can see my own creation - the PIC programmer. This programmer is powered by a PIC 18F2550 microcontroller and interfaces through the serial port. It seamlessly integrates with MPLAB IDE software, Microchip's robust code development environment, facilitating program execution, stopping, and single-stepping.

Thanks to this PIC programmer, I've successfully programmed an extensive array of Microchip PIC series, including the 10F, 12F, 16F, 18F, 24F, and 30F microcontrollers. It's noteworthy that this programmer also doubles as an EEPROM programmer, as it offers support for 12Cxx EEPROMs.

 As a result, by the end of my school years, I had already built my first logic machine. This device was created using TTL integrated circuits and a 27C256 256K bit EPROM chip. Its core function was to measure voltage, frequency, temperature, and RPM, and display the results on a seven-segment display. Users could select different subroutines using buttons on the front panel.

After winning math competitions, I had the opportunity to choose which university to attend. 
I initially entered with the intention of working on automated systems, but my enthusiasm waned when 
I realized that finding a job in this field in Bulgaria was challenging. 
Consequently, during my second year at university, I shifted my focus towards more popular technologies in the web sphere.

Over the course of my career, I've had the privilege of working across a diverse range of companies, each offering unique challenges and opportunities. This journey has provided me with a broad spectrum of experience, spanning from robotic systems to web-based software solutions.

My professional journey has spanned a diverse landscape of technologies and projects, and among them, I take great pride in the following accomplishments:

* Autonomous System Design and Implementation: I led the design and implementation of a remarkable autonomous system. This project called for the integration of various sensor types, including gyroscopes, compasses, GPS, accelerometers, and wheel encoders. We implemented advanced algorithms leveraging odometers and Kalman filters to achieve exceptional results.

* Parking Systems and Traffic Management: I spearheaded the design and implementation of parking systems, traffic counting solutions, and an innovative monitoring and occupancy detection system. These solutions have contributed to optimizing parking operations and traffic management.

* C8Y Agent for DMG MORI's CNC Machines: I engineered a C8Y agent for DMG MORI's CNC machines, a critical component for ensuring the safe and efficient installation of software packages and updates, even in challenging conditions. As part of this project, I introduced a scheduler that effectively manages tasks within defined time windows, significantly enhancing the agent's reliability and performance.

* Custom IIoT Solution for T-Systems: I played a pivotal role in developing a custom solution tailored for T-Systems' IIoT facilities management. This endeavor demanded expertise in cloud computing, data analytics, and the seamless integration of IoT sensors, ultimately contributing to streamlined operations.

* Tailored Migration Solution for Schindler: I engineered a tailored migration solution that adeptly addressed the unique requirements of various device types within Schindler's ecosystem, resulting in a streamlined migration process and minimal downtime.

* OSGi Runtime Platform for Web-Based Solutions**: I undertook the implementation of an OSGi runtime platform for web-based solutions, further diversifying my technical repertoire.

In my career journey, I've navigated a rich tapestry of programming languages, including **Java, Go, C, Qt, JavaScript, PHP, and Erlang** .

Currently, my passion is centered around **JVM (Java), GraalVM, MicroProfile, Quarkus, and Go**. These technologies drive my continuous pursuit of excellence and innovation in the ever-evolving world of software engineering.

I firmly believe that programming languages are merely tools to help us achieve our goals, and my commitment remains unwavering in delivering excellence in software development.
