Hello there! 
On this page, I'd like to share more about myself. My name is Ivelin Yanev, and I was born in Burgas, Bulgaria. Looking back, my passion for technology was ignited by my father, who, like a typical Bulgarian, was skilled at home repairs. As life unfolded, I found myself in a technical school with a specialization in radio and television. It was there that I became a radio amateur and started collecting and restoring vintage Bulgarian equipment, primarily from the socialist era. This included a wide range of radio and television receivers, both assembled from discrete components and integrated units. Thankfully, during the socialist era, Bulgaria was a prominent producer of such equipment, with brands like Elpron, Pliska, Veliki Tarnovo 84, Resprom, Sofia 81, and Shipka leading the way.

To be candid, my software knowledge was quite limited during that period. However, I stumbled upon a renowned Bulgarian book from the golden age of Bulgarian computer production. This book, titled "Do-it-yourself Microcomputer," provided detailed instructions on how to design a microcomputer from scratch. Inspired by this resource, I delved into working with microcontrollers from the PIK16 series, which were manufactured by the American company Microchip.

In the image below, you can see my own creation - the PIC programmer. This programmer is powered by a PIC 18F2550 microcontroller and interfaces through the serial port. It seamlessly integrates with MPLAB IDE software, Microchip's robust code development environment, facilitating program execution, stopping, and single-stepping.

Thanks to this PIC programmer, I've successfully programmed an extensive array of Microchip PIC series, including the 10F, 12F, 16F, 18F, 24F, and 30F microcontrollers. It's noteworthy that this programmer also doubles as an EEPROM programmer, as it offers support for 12Cxx EEPROMs.

 As a result, by the end of my school years, I had already built my first logic machine. This device was created using TTL integrated circuits and a 27C256 256K bit EPROM chip. Its core function was to measure voltage, frequency, temperature, and RPM, and display the results on a seven-segment display. Users could select different subroutines using buttons on the front panel.

After winning math competitions, I had the opportunity to choose which university to attend. I initially entered with the intention of working on automated systems, but my enthusiasm waned when I realized that finding a job in this field in Bulgaria was challenging. Consequently, during my second year at university, I shifted my focus towards more popular technologies in the web sphere.

Over the years, I've gained experience working in various companies, contributing to the design of robotic systems, industrial IoT solutions, web-based systems, and integrated parking systems. As a seasoned software engineer, I have extensive expertise in IoT, IIoT, Microservices, IoT Edge Gateway, and M2M. In recent years, my primary focus has been on developing critical and high-performance microservice-oriented systems using cutting-edge technologies such as Java Native Image and Go. With a solid grasp of software design patterns and architectural principles, I consistently deliver solutions that exceed client expectations while adhering to industry best practices. I've also dabbled in various programming languages, including Java, C, Qt, JavaScript, PHP, and Erlang, but currently, my main focus is on JVM technologies. I firmly believe that programming languages are merely tools to achieve our goals.
